# OWASP Top 10 Demonstration Project

This repository contains demonstration code and examples for the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) security vulnerabilities. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific OWASP Top 10 vulnerability, with code, documentation, and examples to help you understand and mitigate these common security risks.

## Structure

- `A01/`: Demonstrates **Broken Access Control** (vulnerable and best practice routes)
- `A02/`: Demonstrates **Cryptographic Failures** (vulnerable and best practice routes)
- (Add more directories for each OWASP Top 10 item as you implement them)

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the subdirectory for the vulnerability you want to explore (e.g., `A01/`).
2. Follow the README in each subdirectory for setup and usage instructions.
3. Run the example applications to see vulnerabilities in action and learn how to fix them.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (for most examples)
- See each subdirectory's `requirements.txt` for dependencies

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues or submit pull requests to improve the examples or documentation.
